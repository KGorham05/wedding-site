# Wedding Website – Project Roadmap

## Phase 1: Setup & Structure
- Initialize Next.js project with Tailwind CSS and shadcn components
- Configure Git repository and connect to Vercel
- Create page structure:
  - Home
  - Story
  - Wedding Party
  - RSVP
  - Travel & Accommodations
  - Registry
  - Contact

---

## Phase 2: Content Integration
- Insert placeholder copy and images based on Cousin Meeting Prep document
- Ensure all pages are navigable and responsive

---

## Phase 3: Styling & Design
**Prompting Guidance for AI Tools**
- Always provide **hex codes** for target colors
- Specify **contrast ratio goals** (WCAG AA or AAA)
- State **exact element types** to be updated (e.g., `buttons`, `headings`, `background sections`)
- Limit each AI request to **one visual goal per run** (e.g., "Fix button hover colors for better accessibility" instead of "Improve colors and layout")
- Request **before/after examples** in output
- Avoid vague terms like “make it pop” — instead use descriptive design terms (“increase saturation by 15%,” “switch background to #F9FAFB”)

---

## Phase 4: Media Replacement
- Replace placeholders with finalized photos and videos
- Optimize images for web performance (under 300KB, next-gen formats where possible)

---

## Phase 5: Accessibility & QA
- Verify text/background contrast with a color contrast checker
- Test across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Validate all forms work correctly

---

## Phase 6: Deployment
- Connect custom domain on Vercel
- Final review with cousin
- Launch live site

---

## Phase 7: Post-Launch
- Monitor visitor interactions (if analytics added)
- Make small tweaks based on feedback
