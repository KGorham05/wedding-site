What to Wear

Daytime + Adventures
Keep it casual and comfy ‚Äî swimsuits for the lake, shorts and tees for lounging at the ranch, and activewear for rafting, floating, or hiking. Don‚Äôt forget water shoes or sandals you can get wet.
BBQ Cowboy Night at the Ranch
This one calls for Montana chic with a western twist. Boots, denim, hats, flowy skirts, or casual dresses all fit right in. Basically, wear something you‚Äôd be comfortable eating BBQ in and then sitting around a firepit under the stars.

Reception Night ‚Äì Montana Cocktail
Our reception at Sanctuary at Crows Hollow is outdoors on the grass with a dance floor under the stars. Think cocktail hour meets the mountains: flowy dresses, jumpsuits, chinos, boots, or nice shirts. Skip the stilettos - flats, boots, sandals, or block heels will keep you happy on the grass and the dance floor.

Montana Nights
Even in August, the evenings can cool down. Bring a sweater, shawl, or jacket so you can cozy up once the sun dips behind the mountains.

About Us
Our story began at the Sheraton in Carlsbad too long ago to count, where we worked side by side for years. First came friendship, long shifts, late-night laughs, and teamwork that slowly turned into something more. Jeff says he first fell for my smile‚Ä¶ but let‚Äôs be honest, it was my booty. His words, not mine!

Some of our earliest ‚Äúdates‚Äù weren‚Äôt really dates at all. They were just two friends closing out the night with happy-hour beers, Snake Bites, and pizookies at BJ‚Äôs after work. Somewhere between the laughter, the cookies, and those late-night talks, we realized we had stumbled into something special.

Fast forward over a decade later and SURPRISE! In March 2025, we finally made it official on paper. But one piece was still missing ‚Äî the celebration. Not just any celebration, but one surrounded by mountains, fresh air, and the people we love most.

Montana has become our sanctuary. It is where we recharge, laugh, and fall in love with life all over again. Its peace, pace, and beauty won us over, and it feels only right to share that magic with the people who mean the most to us.

So here we are, inviting you to join us under the Big Sky in 2026. Not just to celebrate our marriage, but to share this special moment with all of you. We cannot wait for the adventures, the laughter, the dancing, and the memories we will make together.
